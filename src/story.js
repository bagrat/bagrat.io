      'At some point in time, for whatever time is, symbolically denoted as 1991, a lump of organic matter constituting a life-form has been manifested and bound by gravity to a muddy sphere that is called Earth by the same kind of cellular beings called humans. A combination of letters, a nifty abstract invention by the same organic kind, was attached to this new one by the biological creators of that being, commonly referred to as parents, in order to reduce the issues of identification in organized groups of humans called society. This combination of letters is called "a name" and the name is Bagrat (bug-rut, emphasis on "rut", fortunately not on "bug").',
      'Before this Bagrat would disintegrate in an evolutionary cycle of being eaten and pooped by other organic systems, it voluntarily desired to join the V7 team. In doing so, he made this web-site with the modest expectation that it will be viewed by other human beings who have enough association with V7 Labs that grants them power to arrange an interview.',
      'Since the website is intended to demonstrate "a proven interest in computer science from a young age", it tells a story back from when Bagrat had his initial encounters with actual computers, since his arguably conscious stage of life. While the next 15 minutes may possibly be the most boring 50 minutes of your life, still, please bear with me...or panda with me.',

      'Bagrat got his first computer at home when he was 12. It was a moderate desktop PC enough for his mother to carry some programming work to be done at home. He would sit and watch her write weird text in Visual Basic that would make windows and buttons do some meaningful stuff.',
      'Over time, patterns emerged in Bagrat\'s mind, motivating him to get a hand or two dirty. With his very basic knowledge of Basic and an idea from a future informatics teacher he wrote a program for the school that would speak out an Armenian word and expect it to be written into a textbox to be spellchecked.',
      'This won him a waiver from the upcoming Turbo Pascal classes in the 8th grade. So he used this free time to learn C/C++ to later be used in programming olympiads.',
      'Before starting the 8th grade, Bagrat spent the summer working in a local electronics store, assembling hundreds of desktop PCs. One day he attempted to insert the RAM into the motherboard the other way around, and feeling resistance he applied more force onto it. He got a broken RAM and motherboard socket in return.',
      'This taught him that if something requires brute force intervention, it most probably means something is wrong about the approach in the first place. This applied in many other aspects of life in future and turned out to prove itself.',

      'Now Bagrat was excited to find more problems he could use programming to solve. Among a few, he wrote an Excel VBA app for the same electronics store to compare the numbers in accounting and inventory records. Here he faced the limitations of Excel as a data structure without even having the concept of data structure in his vocabulary.',
      'Later, during his first year of Physics undergraduate studies at the age of 17, he learnt C#, which offered a GUI designer similar to Visual Basic and syntax close enough to C/C++. He used it to write a GUI program for simple inventory and POS operations management for a pharmacy. Even though it worked, it was a brittle collection of GUI component event handlers making direct SQL queries.',
      'The best lesson here for him was that the business processes tend to evolve, thus changing the requirements and problem definitions over time, and so the code needs to account for that.',

      'The passion about programming gave Bagrat some popularity among his more academically-inclined peers. This led to a class-mate referring Bagrat to her uncle, running a local business developing a proprietary wireless transceiver, who was looking for cheap labor, otherwise called interns.',
      'At his 18, Bagrat got this job where he initially used C# to develop a GUI application to tweak the configuration of the transceiver. He then gradually moved more towards the transceiver side, writing C code on AVR32 microcontrollers.',
      'As one of his major projects he integrated a 3rd-party WiFi chip onto the modem as a wireless alternative to RS232 for data transmission and configuration. While this might sound fancy, it was essentially calling the right custom functions from inside the right WiFi library callbacks. But the important side of this is that it required Bagrat to learn and understand the OSI model.',
      'Even though this world of embedded software was extremely interesting for him, it was rigid and wouldn\'t allow fast experiments. So Bagrat started learning OOP and Java to head towards the Web.',

      'In 2012 Bagrat graduated with a Physics bachelor\'s degree and started master\'s degree in Computer and Information Science. At the same time he landed a new job as a Java back-end developer for a matchmaking website company.',
      'At this job he was mainly implementing new controllers and fixing bugs. But more importantly he got to use version control and wrote tests for the first time, which were satisfying solutions to issues he had faced first-hand at his previous projects. Here he also got introduced to Agile, Scrum specifically.',
      'In parallel, the graduate studies took all the practical knowledge Bagrat had, combined with the new theoretical ones, and properly categorized them all, putting everything into appropriate mental shelves. Now he had a solid map to navigate giving him efficiency of looking for solutions in the right areas.',
      'At his next job, the requirements gathering for e-commerce and government apps were going pretty slowly, which was giving Bagrat a lot of free time to learn and experiment with continuous integration, write shell scripts for deployment and take number of online courses, one of which was the famous Stanford Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng.',

He read all the official tutorials and language reference of Python, but most of his core Python knowledge came from answering Stack Overflow questions.',
      'So he landed another job as a Python developer at Aarki developing an advertisement platform. The two most interesting and new aspects Bagrat learnt and dealt with here were system architecture design and configuration management. Most notably, he learnt about HTTP load-balancing, that data storage is not limited to relational databases and that those need to be replicated.',

      'A senior colleague of Bagrat\'s once shared his excitement about this functional language called Elixir. He had a look into it - started to learn without much coding. It didn\'t go well at first and Bagrat stopped at Sigils.',
      'After reading a few books by Basecamp, he decided to up his skills by learning some web front-end, having in mind to become able to build and ship things end-to-end. Not being a big fan of JavaScript he was looking for an alternative, and that\'s how he stumbled upon Elm.',
      'After some learning and hacking with Elm, Bagrat was feeling a new kind of unexplainable but satisfactory joy, as if he received a brain massage. He quickly realized that it was because of the language being functional, and decided to give Elixir another try.',
      'The excitement allowed him to go through the language basics pretty quickly this time and reach the OTP part of things soon. This is where Bagrat was amazed and realized there is no going back. So he started to dive deep into Elixir to eventually find a job...',

      'Here he witnessed how catastrophically off could naming of domain concepts ever be done. The least problem of it was that discussions during meetings would not make any sense to a person new to it all. But the worst part was that when you start to make sense, it would erode your thinking so bad that you would be caught in the trap of not being able to produce any new sensible work going forwards.',
      'This taught Bagrat to be generous for the time dedicated to naming, which will pay off in multiples later. Being underpowered on staff and having to spend most of the time patching 3 different, chronologically sequential legacy codebases in JavaScript to keep the critical operations going, he eventually gave up and moved on.',

Other than finding the product and the company very appealing, he was happy to learn that no prior Elixir experience is required, so there was nothing stopping him from applying other than learning Vue.js and making this website.
