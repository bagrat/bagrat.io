And since that was more than 18 years ago, it is written with a modest hope that <strong>V7 Labs</strong> team will take the time to read through it all.',

      "Bagrat was 12 when a computer appeared at their home, a moderate PC enough for his mother to carry home some programming work. He watched her write weird text in Visual Basic that would make windows and buttons do some meaningful stuff.",
      'Over time, patterns emerged in Bagrat\'s mind, motivating him to get a hand or two dirty. With his very basic knowledge of Basic and an idea from the future informatics teacher he wrote a program that would speak out a word and expect it to be written into a textbox to be spellchecked. This won him a waiver from the upcoming Pascal classes in the 8th grade, so he used this free time to learn C/C++ to later be used in programming olympiads.',
      'The same summer, Bagrat worked in a local electronics store, assembling hundreds of PCs. Once he attempted to insert a RAM the other way around, and feeling resistance he applied more force, breaking it along with the motherboard socket. He realized that a need for brute force usually indicates faulty approach in the first place.'

      "Now Bagrat was excited to find more problems he could use programming to solve. Among a few, he wrote an Excel VBA app for the same electronics store to compare the numbers in accounting and inventory records. Here he faced the limitations of Excel as a data structure without even having the concept of data structure in his vocabulary.",
      "Later, during his first year of Physics undergraduate studies at the age of 17, he learnt C# to write a GUI program for simple inventory and POS operations management for a pharmacy. Even though it worked, it was a brittle collection of GUI component event handlers making direct SQL queries.",
      "The best lesson here for him was that the business processes tend to evolve, thus changing the requirements and problem definitions over time, and so the code needs to account for that.",

      'At his 18, Bagrat got this job where he started developing a C# GUI application to configure the transceiver over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232">RS-232</a>. He then gradually moved towards the lower-level, writing C code on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVR32">AVR32 microcontrollers</a>.',
      'As one of his major projects he integrated a 3rd-party Wi-Fi chip onto the modem. While this might sound fancy, it was essentially about calling the right custom functions from inside the right callbacks. But more importantly it required Bagrat to learn and understand the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">OSI model</a>.',

      "He got to use version control and wrote tests for the first time, which were satisfying solutions to issues he had faced first-hand previously. Here he also got introduced to Agile, Scrum specifically.",
      "In parallel, the graduate studies took Bagrat's practical knowledge, wrapped in theoretical fundamentals and properly categorized them all into appropriate mental shelves. Now he had a solid map to navigate, allowing him to look for solutions in the right areas.",

      'After graduating with master\'s degree, Bagrat wanted something new to learn, and by random development of events, it turned out to be Python, which he loved especially for meta-programming abilities. He read all the official tutorials and language reference of Python, but most of his core Python knowledge came from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/3264192/bagrat">answering Stack Overflow questions</a>.',
      'So he landed another job as a Python developer for <a href="https://www.aarki.com/">an advertisement platform</a>. The two most interesting and new aspects Bagrat learnt and dealt with here were system architecture design and configuration management. Most notably, he learnt about HTTP load-balancing, that data storage is not limited to relational databases and that those need to be replicated.',

Not being a big fan of JavaScript he was looking for an alternative, and that\'s how he stumbled upon Elm.',
      "After some learning and hacking with Elm, Bagrat was feeling a new kind of unexplainable but satisfactory joy, as if he received a brain massage. He quickly realized that it was because of the language being functional, and decided to give Elixir another try.",
      "The excitement allowed him to go through the language basics pretty quickly this time and reach the OTP part of things soon. This is where Bagrat was amazed and realized there is no going back. So he started to dive deep into Elixir to eventually find a job...",

The actual challenge of it though was that after understanding the concepts and thinking in those terms, it was nearly impossible to add new work in that context that would make sense. Being underpowered on staff and having to spend most of the time patching the legacy to keep the critical operations going, he eventually gave up and moved on.',
